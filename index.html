            <h2>Check Their Portfolio</h2>
            <p>A designer’s portfolio can give you a clear picture of their style and capabilities. Browse through completed projects to determine if their design approach aligns with your vision. Whether it’s landscape lighting or outdoor water feature design, their portfolio should reflect creativity and technical skill.

            <h2>Understand Their Services</h2>
            <p>Not all landscape designers offer the same services. Some specialize in residential backyard landscaping, while others focus on commercial landscape contracting. When interviewing potential designers, ask about the range of services they provide.

Additionally, ensure they offer a formal contract that outlines the project scope, timeline, and payment terms.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Evaluate Their Use of Technology</h2>

This technology is particularly useful for large-scale projects, as it minimizes errors and ensures your satisfaction with the final design.</p>
